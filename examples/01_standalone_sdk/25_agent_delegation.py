Agent Delegation Example

This example demonstrates the agent delegation feature where a main agent
delegates tasks to sub-agents for parallel processing.

The main agent receives a high-level programming task "Analyze this Python file for
quality."
The main agent decomposes the task into two parallel subtasks:
- Sub-agent 1: perform linting (detect style issues or naming problems)
- Sub-agent 2: perform complexity analysis (count functions or measure cyclomatic
  complexity)

Each sub-agent runs independently and returns its results to the main agent,
which then merges both analyses into a single consolidated report.

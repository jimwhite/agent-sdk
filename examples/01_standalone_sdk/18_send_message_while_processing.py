"""
Example demonstrating that user messages can be sent and processed while
an agent is busy.

This example demonstrates a key capability of the OpenHands agent system: the ability
to receive and process new user messages even while the agent is actively working on
a previous task. This is made possible by the agent's event-driven architecture.

Demonstration Flow:
1. Send initial message asking agent to:
   - Write "Message 1 sent at [time], written at [CURRENT_TIME]"
   - Wait 3 seconds
   - Write "Message 2 sent at [time], written at [CURRENT_TIME]"
    [time] is the time the message was sent to the agent
    [CURRENT_TIME] is the time the agent writes the line
2. Start agent processing in a background thread
3. While agent is busy (during the 3-second delay), send a second message asking to add:
   - "Message 3 sent at [time], written at [CURRENT_TIME]"
4. Verify that all three lines are processed and included in the final document

Expected Evidence:
The final document will contain three lines with dual timestamps:
- "Message 1 sent at HH:MM:SS, written at HH:MM:SS" (from initial message, written immediately)
- "Message 2 sent at HH:MM:SS, written at HH:MM:SS" (from initial message, written after 3-second delay)
- "Message 3 sent at HH:MM:SS, written at HH:MM:SS" (from second message sent during delay)

The timestamps will show that Message 3 was sent while the agent was running,
but was still successfully processed and written to the document.

This proves that:
- The second user message was sent while the agent was processing the first task
- The agent successfully received and processed the second message
- The agent's event system allows for real-time message integration during processing

Key Components Demonstrated:
- Conversation.send_message(): Adds messages to events list immediately
- Agent.step(): Processes all events including newly added messages
- Threading: Allows message sending while agent is actively processing

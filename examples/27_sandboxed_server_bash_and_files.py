"""
Example demonstrating bash execution and file operations with sandboxed agent servers.

This example shows how to:
1. Start a sandboxed agent server (Docker or Remote)
2. Execute bash commands in the sandboxed environment
3. Upload files to the sandboxed environment
4. Download files from the sandboxed environment
5. Upload file content directly

Run with:

"""Tests for batch atomicity in View.from_events().

This module tests that multi-action batches (multiple ActionEvents from the same
LLM response) are treated atomically during condensation. This is critical for
extended thinking models like Claude Sonnet 4.5, where thinking blocks must stay
with their associated tool calls.
